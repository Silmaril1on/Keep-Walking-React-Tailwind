    info: "The main ingredient of these whiskies is maize, wheat, or both, rather than barley. They can come from a single distillery or be blended from different distilleries across Scotland. Grain whiskies have a lighter, creamy flavor, which make them ideal in whisky blends, where they bring together the flavors of single malts.",

    info: "A Blended Scotch Whisky is made by mixing together Single Malt Whiskies and Single Grain Whiskies. This creates a broader depth of flavor and allows the flavor and quality of the whisky to stay the same time after time. When a Blended Whisky states its age, this refers to the youngest whisky used in the blend.",
